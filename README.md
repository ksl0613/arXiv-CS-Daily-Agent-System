# arXiv-CS-Daily-Agent-System
This project implements a multi-agent AI system that collaboratively develops a complete FastAPI web application from scratch. The system demonstrates "agentic AI" in software engineering, where specialized AI agents work together to plan, code, evaluate, and refine software projects based on natural language task descriptions.
